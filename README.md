FlyAnywhere ✈️

A lightweight SwiftUI prototype for exploring flexible flights.

Overview

FlyAnywhere is a simple travel-search app built for my iOS challenge.
Users can pick flexible dates, months, nights, and quickly view mock flight results.

The goal was not to build a full product, but to practice:
	•	Clean SwiftUI layout
	•	Using native components (NavigationStack, List, Toggle)
	•	Handling user inputs
	•	Creating a simple, intuitive UX flow

⸻

Inspiration

The design is inspired by Kiwi.com and Skyscanner.
Both apps are clean, but flexible dates are a bit hidden —
so I created a smaller, simpler version focused only on flexible travel.
